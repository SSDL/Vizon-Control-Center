Future changes.

Integrate mission selection into graphing page.

Integrate the two databases.  I see no issues with them being in one.  Works right
now though.

Need to change the way models in taplog are made.  I'm no longer using field values,
so the whole concept of having a f: { n: "", v: * } in there is obsolete.  Doesn't harm
anyone right now though.
